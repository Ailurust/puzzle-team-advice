Introduction

*(the remainder of this page is sourced from qqwref's doc)*

Boggle is my worst puzzle. It is also the single most difficult puzzle (judging by the number of people with averages
on the harder difficulties), and only this and word search can’t be considered true logic puzzles. At least word search
has a unique solution.

Languages
---------

Play on English, obviously. Bulgarian is okay if you know it. Japanese is probably faster if you know it, because there seem
to be less words, but it’s only available on the easy difficulties. Spanish has way too many words and should probably be
avoided even if you’re fluent.

Points System
-------------

The points system is taken from the real game. 3 and 4 letter words are both worth only 1 point. 5-letter words are 2,
6-letter words are 3, 7-letter words are 5, and 8-letter words and higher are 11 for some reason. There seems to be a cutoff
of a minimum number of points that will be allowed in a puzzle, like 250 for 4x4, and that affects the number of points you
need for a solve, so if you’re going for a good single solve it’s worth it to reset any puzzles with a high number of points.

Technique
---------

For 3x3 easy, you can pretty much go through adding whatever words you see. For anything else you should be more systematic.
I try to go letter by letter and only do words that start with that letter before moving on, or even pairs or triplets of
letters (any words that start with KH, any words that start with KW, then KE, then AK, etc.) depending on how hard/large the
puzzle is. It’s also possible to brute force through 3, 4, or even 5 letter words if you want to. Boggle uses a huge
dictionary (Collins Scrabble Words) so there are a ton of words that you won’t recognize but that are counted as words
anyway, so enter in things that look like they might be words too.
