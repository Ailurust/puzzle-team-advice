Puzzle Team Advice
==================

This documentation provides useful advice for the logic puzzles
found on the `PuzzleTeam websites <https://puzzle-loop.com>`_.
All members of the community are welcome to contribute!

These docs are heavily based off qqwref's Google Doc of the same name, found `here <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nPSvKhus85OFjCRBSghea3UnVFGMcXyMkEN68znJOFA>`_.
The difference between this site and the doc are that this aims to have fully updated and clarified information,
guides on newer puzzles not included in the original, and the ability for anyone to suggest changes or additions.

.. note::

   This project is still very much a work in progress! If you have any problems,
   contact me through the PuzzleTeam discord server (@beatrixwashere),
   or create an issue in the GitHub repository. Thanks!
