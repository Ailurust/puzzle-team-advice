Contributing
============

This page covers how you can make changes to the documentation.
You're also welcome to ask me to change something through the Discord server,
but here I'm focusing on editing it yourself.

1. Create a GitHub account if you don't already have one.
2. Fork `this repository <https://github.com/beatrixwashere/puzzle-team-advice>`_
   using the button in the top right.
3. Once you're done modifying the source, create a pull request.
   For now, simply merge into the main branch.
   Read the Docs also has a feature where you can see what the docs look like with the changes.
4. I check GitHub relatively often and will probably see the pull request at some point,
   but you're also welcome to let me know you made it.
5. After I've reviewed the changes, I'll merge it into the main branch,
   and the changes will appear once the automated build is done.
   As of right now, I'm the only one with permission to merge, but if anyone else is willing to
   help with uploading appropriate changes then please contact me.

Thanks for being willing to help out! If you have any questions about this process, again just ask me.
