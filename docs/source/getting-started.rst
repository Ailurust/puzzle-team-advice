General Tips
------------

*(by qqwref)*

* Always turn on “Auto submit”.
* Use a mouse, not trackpad/touchscreen.
* Make an account and play logged in so you can save averages.
* Night mode is optional. I like to turn it on for Sudoku-based puzzles to help see similar digits.
* I recommend solving smaller puzzles on the puzzles-mobile.com site on desktop.
  The latency feels a bit lower and the screen doesn’t move around when loading a new puzzle,
  saving you precious fractions of a second.
* Many hard puzzles can be solved faster with “uniqueness” logic, see below.
* If you make a guess, try to remember where you made it, and then you can use Ctrl+Z (undo)
  to return to the point you guessed at and keep going.
* On very difficult puzzles, using checkpoints is worth it. Keep a save with only deductions you know are correct.
* If you want the best total score, finish as many averages as you possibly can, even if the times are bad.
  Then you can work on optimizing them later.
* Take advantage of the generator. This understanding will come with practice, but basically,
  if you notice anything special about the design of the puzzles or their solutions,
  you can take advantage of that when solving.
* Made a mistake? Don’t immediately reset. Instead, see if you can fix it by changing nearby squares.
  If you can’t, but you’re on a streak, either clear out that section of the puzzle and re-solve it, or start over entirely.
* If you want to adjust a puzzle’s settings without wasting time or breaking your streak, finish one solve,
  then hit “start over” and adjust them then.
* Zoom in if you are having trouble seeing clues/marks or consistently clicking in the right place.
* Google en passant
* Practice!!!!!


Terminology
----------

Some terms are used fairly consistently accross different puzzle types.

  **Cell** - a single square on a grid-based puzzle
  **Region** - an enclosed group of cells
  **Clue/Given** - a piece of information provided in the base state of a particular puzzle
  

About Uniqueness
----------

*(also by qqwref)*

Also known as “Highlander” logic, the idea is that when solving a logic puzzle, you are not just given the clues,
but one additional and important bit of information: the puzzle has exactly one solution. In some puzzle types,
this actually turns out to be very powerful. And in fact, the harder the puzzle, the more powerful it tends to be,
because applying uniqueness principles can quickly find contradictions that would otherwise be much more difficult
to uncover. Some people prefer not to use this kind of logic because it avoids the intended solving path.
I think it’s fine for computer-generated puzzles like the ones here, but I try to avoid it when doing hand-set puzzles.

Sometimes uniqueness logic can take the form of a simple pattern, where when you see it you can make a deduction,
because the opposite of that deduction would immediately give that section of the puzzle either zero solutions or
at least two of them. I give a simple example of that in Loop below. Other times, it’s something you may discover
when doing guess-and-check. If you make a guess and it leads to an isolated section of the puzzle that clearly has
at least two solutions, then that counts as a contradiction and your initial guess was invalid. Be careful to check
that those two solutions really work just as well as each other though, or else you might reject a valid guess.

This is a pretty deep topic and the situations that apply are totally different for each puzzle.
It would probably take another whole document to go through it in detail. I think it’s good to be aware of this idea though,
and as you play more of a puzzle, you may discover some useful situations or patterns for yourself.
